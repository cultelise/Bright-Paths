// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning =
  'This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.';
const analysis =
  'The second step, analysis of requirements, involves discovering/determining ways the plan can be implemented in accordance with established business principles and collected data sets. ';
const design =
  'In the third step, design, the "how" of the development process is approached. During this step, a software "blueprint" is drafted, analyzed, and agreed upon.';
const implementation =
  'The fourth step involves the nitty gritty of the software development process. The "house" of the software project is built (coded) in accordance with the design plan.';
const testing =
  'The fifth step, testing & integration, puts the newly implemented application through the ringer. This step ensures that the app works properly and runs well in its designated environment.';
const maintain =
  'Finally, in the sixth step, the maintenance process consists of collecting feedback, debugging, and updating the application in order to keep it fully functional within the ever-advancing world of software.';
