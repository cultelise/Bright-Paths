  <h1>Hi, I'm Elise.</h1>

  <div id="skills">
    <p>Thanks for visiting my profile page.</p>
    <p>
      I don't consider myself very skilled, but some things I can do well
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Writing</li>
      <li>Investigating</li>
      <li>Debating</li>
    </ul>

    />
  </p>

  <div class="basic">
    <p>
      So many things have the potential to interest me.
      <br />
      I love to learn about the world and how it works.
      <br />
      Biology, spirituality, technology, gaming, sports & more...
      <br />
      I'm also a lifelong reader and love a good book!
    </p>

  <div class="basic">
    <p>
      In my career, I'd love to use the skills I mentioned above, together with
      what I've learned about life, to be of service to the disadvantaged. I
      would love to work with children, those who are disabled, and the trans
      BIPOC community.
