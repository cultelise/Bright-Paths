        <p class="line">On and on and on and on and on and on and on.</p>
        <p class="line">Endlessly meandering. Never. Sometimes wrong.</p>
        <p class="line">Up and down and all around, we look but cannot find.</p>
        <p class="line">
          And when we go, we always know; we'll leave this world behind.
        </p>
        <p class="line">Silent seekers come and go.</p>
        <p class="line">They wait for us beyond.</p>
        <p class="line">Waiting. Seeking. Wandering.</p>
        <p class="line">Our children are all gone.</p>
        <p class="line">We know there's more that's yet in store.</p>
        <p class="line">The story doesn't end.</p>
        <p class="line">So when we would, if yet we could--</p>
        <p class="line">An ellipsis we append.</p>
